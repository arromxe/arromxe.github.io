- I am 27 years old
- I am Dutch
- I have a 9-5 job as a programmer
- I have lived in Groningen fo 9 years and have this city in my heart.
- I have made art since I was young, mainly music.
- I am sorry if what I write seems vague, I have a hard time articulating what I feel with words.
- I articulate complex emotions through art.
- My art is meant to escape into.
- I want to provide a safe escape for those who struggle in daily life.
