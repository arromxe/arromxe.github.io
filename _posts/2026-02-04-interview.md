# Interview with Illsaberr

**Date:** February 4, 2026

Illsaberr — when you hear your own name as an artist, what does it represent to you right now, and how did that identity first take shape?

It's partly inspired by Bladee, with doubling the last letter, and there is the aesthetic of being "sick" that intrigues me. That’s how Illsaberr came together — a non-serious approach to coming up with a name really. It seemed adjacent to the scene I was trying to partake in.

I try to keep this "artist" separate from myself. I don't feel like it is attached to me — more that I *have* it among other artist personas I could have. This is just my main project. Sometimes I tap into being Illsaberr, exploring aesthetics and ideas that don’t correspond to real life. This artist allows me to express myself in a way I can’t otherwise.

When I make music, I tap mostly into my guilty pleasures — things that are bad but feel good, like craving experiences you shouldn’t have. I am sober, by the way. The process requires complete solitude, like a "black box." In that moment, hyperfocus takes over — jaws locked sometimes from excitement — and I feel completely free to create. That intensity lasts a few days or maybe a week, and it is both exhausting and exhilarating. Afterward, stepping back allows perspective to return, helping me notice what’s off, especially in the mix.

I aim for instinct. Every decision is made fully committed, often without backups. That trust in intuition makes my work unique. The resulting sound emerges less from conscious shaping than from my state of being — I know what to work on in detail, what to add quickly. Ideas usually start as partial earworms in my head, which I then capture and expand in the software. Once the music exists physically, it feels like a node in the multidimensional space of my inspiration — everything I’ve experienced contributes to it.

I see my frame of reference as a *window* rather than a toolbox. It inevitably shapes the music, and every moment — mood, circumstances — acts as a seed that determines the outcome. Music guides me; I simply make it physical. Years of practice have taught me to translate instinct into sound quickly and effectively. Once the idea is out, intuition takes over, producing volatile, unpredictable choices. Recurring preferences emerge — types of beats or chords — but always with a twist.

I create singles rather than albums, imagining them inhabiting the same world. Visuals often accompany music afterward — sometimes abstract, sometimes literal, whimsical or dark. Inspiration is like a hallucination: I recombine what I know to imagine something new. Intuition allows ideas to mutate, producing entire new concepts spontaneously.

Collaboration is rare and selective. Vocals may be added, but production remains entirely self-driven. Shelved tracks are stored if they don’t fit the current wave of ideas, preserving the integrity of my world. I aim to publish quickly, capturing the energy before it moves on.

Making music is both joy and necessity — it excites me and regulates my emotions. The black-box state is a temporal and physical space where time dissolves, and I can safely channel darker, craving-driven energies. Music is a release, a containment, and a safety mechanism. Without it, I would project those energies elsewhere.

The first spark for a track is usually melodic and rhythmic — a hook — which I refine and expand into a full piece. I focus on *instinct*, letting the track take shape naturally. I rarely assess whether it "sounds like me"; it either does or it doesn’t. The process is deeply personal, with publishing serving as a separate, controlled act. Feedback is appreciated but not essential; the work exists first for me. 

I respect artists who pursue public recognition, but I prefer to keep Illsaberr isolated from my real life. The artist contains a darker, more instinctual part of me, which remains safe within boundaries I control. The black-box state is not indulgent — it is functional, allowing those emotions to exist fully without consequence.
