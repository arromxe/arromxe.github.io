I aspire to inspire. 

Concretely I aspire to create on any medium I can get my hands on and inspire those who consume it, contributing to the frames of reference of my audience. 

I would like to expand my work: use big high resolution screens for digital art and moving, morphing images. And much much more. I want to create worlds to escape in.
