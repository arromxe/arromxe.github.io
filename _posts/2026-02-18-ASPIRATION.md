I aspire to inspire. 

Concretely I aspire to create on any medium I can get my hands on and inspire those who consume it, contributing to creation by expanding their frames of reference. 

I would like to inspire my audience to use escape to achieve the opposite: live life as it comes.

I want to provide a black box in which one can escape without getting lost. 

I create to understand myself and help others once I do.

I try to be the best I can be, and feel so ecstatic when I'm inspired. That is what I would like to propagate. I live for art, it's inevitable.

I would love, and desperately need to have a platform and guidance to achieve my goals.
